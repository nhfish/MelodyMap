# Melody Map
Discover songs from your favorite kids' movies â€” fast.
Melody Map is a simple, visual-first app that helps parents, grandparents, babysitters, and caregivers quickly find, play, and enjoy songs from animated and live-action movies.

Built with scalability in mind, Melody Map starts with a clean search-driven experience and aims to grow into a smart, automated music discovery tool for families.

## Features
ðŸŽµ **Smart Song Search** â€” instantly find any song with a single search bar

ðŸŽ¬ **Movie Timeline View** â€” see where each song appears in the movie with an intuitive timeline

ðŸ“‹ **Manually Curated Content** â€” all songs are added and tagged by hand to ensure quality

ðŸŽ¯ **Usage Tracking** â€” daily limits (10 views/day) with extension options via ads or premium subscription

ðŸ’Ž **Premium Subscription** â€” unlock unlimited song views with monthly or yearly plans

## Current Development Status

### âœ… **Completed**
- Core app architecture with SwiftUI
- Google Sheets integration via Apps Script
- Search functionality with fuzzy matching
- Timeline view with page transitions
- Usage tracking system with daily quotas
- Quota exceeded sheet UI component
- Mock ad system for development testing
- PurchaseService with compile-time StoreKit guard
- PaywallView with subscription options
- Quota checking integration in Timeline and Search views

### ðŸš§ **In Progress**
- UI polish and refinement
- User experience optimization
- Content management system

### ðŸ“‹ **Planned**
- Google Ads integration (compile-time flag controlled)
- StoreKit subscription implementation (compile-time flag controlled)
- Advanced search features
- Content expansion

## Technical Notes

### Usage Quota System
The app implements a daily usage quota system:
- **Free tier:** 10 song views per day
- **Ad rewards:** +2 views per watched ad
- **Premium subscription:** Unlimited views
- **Reset:** Quota resets at midnight local time

### Google Ads Integration
Google Ads integration is temporarily disabled during development to focus on core functionality. The system uses a mock implementation that simulates successful ad views for testing purposes. This allows development to continue without SDK compatibility issues.

**To re-enable Google Ads later:**
1. Go to Project Settings â–¸ Build Settings â–¸ Other Swift Flags
2. Add `-D ADS_ENABLED`
3. Update to a compatible SDK version (v9.x series recommended for iOS 15.2)
4. Uncomment the Google Mobile Ads implementation
5. Re-add the framework to the project
6. Test with actual ad units

### StoreKit Integration
StoreKit integration is temporarily disabled during development. The system uses a mock implementation that shows "Purchases disabled" alerts for testing purposes.

**To re-enable StoreKit later:**
1. Go to Project Settings â–¸ Build Settings â–¸ Other Swift Flags
2. Add `-D SUBS_ENABLED`
3. Implement StoreKit 2 logic in PurchaseService
4. Test with sandbox environment

### Build Requirements
- iOS 15.2+
- Xcode 13+
- Swift 5.0+

## Target Audience
**Primary:** Parents with children ages 12 months to 7 years

**Secondary:** Grandparents, babysitters, and other caregivers

## Platforms
- **iOS first** (currently in development)
- Android planned

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Swift + SwiftUI for a native iOS experience
- **CMS (initial):** Google Sheets
- **CMS (future scaling):** Full database + admin UI once adoption scales
- **AI Support:** OpenAI Codex assisting with coding tasks

## Design Principles
- One giant search bar for ease of use
- Clean, visual-first timeline (inspired by polished streaming apps)
- Fast, joyful interactions for busy caregivers
- Minimalist UX â€” designed for quick lookups, not deep browsing

## Development Goals
1. Build MVP using Google Sheets as CMS with a native SwiftUI app
2. Refine UX with visual timeline and instant search
3. Collect usage feedback and iterate
4. Prepare for scale: migrate to full database + automated ingest pipeline when appropriate

## Project Status
âœ… Splash screen now stays up until both minimum time and data load are complete
âœ… AppState coordinates splash/data readiness
âœ… MainTabView is deprecated; navigation is now in MelodyMapApp.swift
âœ… SearchViewModel exposes a static loadForAppState for splash gating
âœ… UsageTrackerService is injected at the root
âœ… Only SearchView is the home screen, with overlays for upgrade/profile
âœ… Profile and paywall overlays use new closure-based dismissal
âœ… iOS 15 compatibility (NavigationView); ready for NavigationStack on iOS 16+
ðŸš§ UI polish and refinement in progress
