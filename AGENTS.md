It describes the goals, technologies, features, and known constraints of Melody Map.

Melody Map
Discover songs from your favorite kids' movies — fast.
Melody Map is a simple, visual-first app that helps parents, grandparents, babysitters, and caregivers quickly find, play, and enjoy songs from animated and live-action movies.

Built with scalability in mind, Melody Map starts with a clean search-driven experience and aims to grow into a smart, automated music discovery tool for families.

Features
🎵 Smart Song Search — instantly find any song with a single search bar

🎬 Movie Timeline View — see where each song appears in the movie with an intuitive timeline

📋 Manually Curated Content (initial version) — all songs are added and tagged by hand to ensure quality

🔍 Planned Future Enhancements:

automated metadata ingestion and smart tagging

support for non-song markers (key movie moments, quotes, etc.)

advanced search features (scene-based, mood-based, age-appropriate filters)

Target Audience
Primary: Parents with children ages 12 months to 7 years

Secondary: Grandparents, babysitters, and other caregivers

Platforms
iOS first

Android planned

Tech Stack
Frontend: Unity (leveraging familiarity + potential for rapid cross-platform builds)

CMS (initial): Google Sheets

CMS (future scaling): Full database + admin UI once adoption scales

AI Support: OpenAI Codex assisting with coding tasks

Design Principles
One giant search bar for ease of use

Clean, visual-first timeline (inspired by polished streaming apps)

Fast, joyful interactions for busy caregivers

Minimalist UX — designed for quick lookups, not deep browsing

Development Goals
Build MVP using Google Sheets as CMS and Unity as the app shell

Refine UX with visual timeline and instant search

Collect usage feedback and iterate

Prepare for scale: migrate to full database + automated ingest pipeline when appropriate

Project Status
✅ UX planning complete
✅ Initial architecture chosen
🚧 MVP development in progress
🗺️ Roadmap defined for automated future scaling

License
TBD — likely MIT or similar (to be finalized)
